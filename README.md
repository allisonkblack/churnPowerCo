# Predicting and Preventing Churn 
A data-driven approach to prevent customer churn at a major Spanish power company

In this group project for the final Datathon at IE's Master's of Business Analytics and Big Data, my team framed the mission, provided key insights on the drivers of churn, and explained how we used advanced analytics. We then provided our clinet with a proprietary strategy, reviewed our approach, and outlined an execution plan.
